# Node.js environment

## General Confidence/Workflow

* *Automated Test environment (Nightwatch)*

* **Automated build process (Gulp, NPM/yarn, etc)**

* *Pattern/framework/reactive sites (Vue)*

* **Understanding of HTML / CSS / JS (web developer course)**

* *Linking the front end to databases (MongoDB, InfluxDB, MySQL)*

* *STD .IN / STD .OUT, pipe, arrow*

* Hard Coded

##### Responsive

* Browser computed layouts with minimal scrolling across screen sizes

##### Dynamic

* (Javascript generated HTML code)

#### CSS

##### BEM

* (modifiers and re-usable code)

### Back-end

#### Development Build/Deploy Process

##### NPM/Yarn

##### Gulp/Grunt

* Browserify
    * *TODO: Define Me*
